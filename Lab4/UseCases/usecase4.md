# Use Case 4

<hr>

**Use Case**: *Draw*

**Primary Actor**: *User*

**Goal in Context**: *To allow users to drag and draw over canvas with the last selected color.*

**Preconditions**: *The program must be running and in a responsive state.*

**Trigger**: *Press and hold down the left mouse button, then drag mouse somewhere to draw something.*
  
**Scenario**: *A user will press&hold down the left mouse button and drag it to elsewhere when they want to draw things*
 
**Exceptions**: *The program may become potentially unresponsive. In this case, the program can be terminated by built-in termination actions(See Use Case 5) or from the operating system.*

**Priority**: *High-priority*

**When available**: *First release*

**Channel to actor**: *The primary actor communicates through I/O devices-the mouse. The system is responsible for changing a pixel color when the user presses&holds down mouse and drag it to where they want to draw, and should respond within 1 second of any mouse event. The user is responsible for all other input.*

**Secondary Actor**: *N/A*

**Channels to Secondary Actors**: *N/A*

**Open Issues**: *We may need to build primitive shapes that users can select and apply, such as points, lines, triangles, rectangles, circles.*
