# Use Case 3

<hr>

**Use Case**: *Clear csanvas*

**Primary Actor**: *User*

**Goal in Context**: *To allow users to clear the entire canvas and fill it with the last selected color.*

**Preconditions**: *The program must be running and in a responsive state.*

**Trigger**: *Press the space key.*
  
**Scenario**: *A user will press the space key when they want to clear the entire canvas.*
 
**Exceptions**: *The program may become potentially unresponsive. In this case, the program can be terminated by built-in termination actions(See Use Case 5) or from the operating system.*

**Priority**: *High-priority*

**When available**: *First release*

**Channel to actor**: *The primary actor communicates through I/O devices-the keyboard. The system is responsible for clearing the entire canvas and fill it with the last selected color, and should respond within 1 second of any keyboard event. The user is responsible for the input of space key.*

**Secondary Actor**: *N/A*

**Channels to Secondary Actors**: *N/A*

**Open Issues**: *We may need to devleop one more mold named "default mold" which enables users to choose one defualt color for the canvas, such as white, and the canvas background color will not change during the drawing.*
