# Use Case 2

<hr>

**Use Case**: *Draw in different colors*

**Primary Actor**: *User*

**Goal in Context**: *To allow users to draw in different colors by pressing the number keys 1 to 8*

**Preconditions**: *The program must be running and in a responsive state.*

**Trigger**: *(1) Pressing the number key 1 to draw in Black. (2) Pressing the number key 2 to draw in White. (3) Pressing the number key 3 to draw in Red. (4) Pressing the number key 4 to draw in Green. (5) Pressing the number key 5 to draw in Blue. (6) Pressing the number key 6 to draw in Yellow. (7) Pressing the number key 7 to draw in Magenta. (8) Pressing the number key 8 to draw in Cyan.*
  
**Scenario 1**: *A user will press the number key 1 when they want to draw in Black.*

**Scenario 2**: *A user will press the number key 2 when they want to draw in White.*

**Scenario 3**: *A user will press the number key 3 when they want to draw in Red.*

**Scenario 4**: *A user will press the number key 4 when they want to draw in Green.*

**Scenario 5**: *A user will press the number key 5 when they want to draw in Blue.*

**Scenario 6**: *A user will press the number key 6 when they want to draw in Yellow.*

**Scenario 7**: *A user will press the number key 7 when they want to draw in Magenta.*

**Scenario 8**: *A user will press the number key 8 when they want to draw in Cyan.*
 
**Exceptions**: *The program may become potentially unresponsive. In this case, the program can be terminated by built-in termination actions(See Use Case 5) or from the operating system.*

**Priority**: *High-priority*

**When available**: *First release*

**Channel to actor**: *The primary actor communicates through I/O devices-the keyboard. The system is responsible for changing the drawing colors when the user presses, and should respond within 1 second of any keyboard event. The user is responsible for all other input.*

**Secondary Actor**: *N/A*

**Channels to Secondary Actors**: *N/A*

**Open Issues**: *We may need to support more color choices in the future: (1) add a color section in the titlebar which allows user to choose a color based on RGB values ranging from 0 to 255.*
