  More than 8 hours

  No
- Did you use any external resources? (Cite them below)
  - Google to search some function
- (Optional) What was your favorite part of the assignment?
  hands-on experience because I can see how my codes work and generate an application that I can interact with instantly.
- (Optional) How would you improve the assignment?
  No idea. But for the first learning course, it's not so clear how the codes finally generate such a web page, such as the effect of each line/block of codes. I feel like I was thrown a bunch of codes and it magically works.
